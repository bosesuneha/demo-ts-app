# GitHub Actions OIDC Setup for Azure

Your GitHub workflow has been generated and is ready to deploy to Azure! However, it requires **OIDC authentication** to securely connect to Azure without storing secrets.

## 🔐 Required: Set up OIDC Authentication

### Option 1: Use AKS VS Code Extension (Recommended)
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run: "AKS: Setup OIDC for GitHub Actions"
3. Follow the prompts to create a managed identity and federated credentials
4. Copy the generated secrets to your GitHub repository

### Option 2: Manual Setup
Follow the [official GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure) to:

1. Create an Azure AD application
2. Create a managed identity or service principal  
3. Configure federated identity credentials
4. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

## ⚠️ Without OIDC Setup

Your workflow **will fail** with authentication errors when trying to connect to Azure. The workflow uses `azure/login@v2` which requires these credentials.

## ✅ After OIDC Setup

Once configured, your workflow will:
- Build your container image
- Push to Azure Container Registry
- Deploy to your AKS cluster
- All without storing any secrets in your repository!
